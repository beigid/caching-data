# Caching Data

> A project to practice caching data in the browser.

This project is designed to practice with caching data in `localStorage` using
the `vue-ls` module to help us. The project builds on [the previous refactoring
project](https://shawnr.gitbooks.io/practical-javascript-2-building-applications/content/application-architecture/project-application-architecture.html) where we enhanced the organization of a weather application. We will
work with a weather application that could have come out of that prior refactoring
experience.
